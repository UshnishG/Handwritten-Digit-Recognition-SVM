## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed:

```bash
pip install numpy scikit-learn tensorflow opencv-python pillow joblib
```

### Usage

The main script provides three modes of operation:

#### 1\. Train the Model (First Time Only)

```bash
python main.py train
```

This will:

  * Load the MNIST dataset.
  * Train the CNN for feature extraction.
  * Train the SVM on the extracted features.
  * Save the combined trained model as `cnn_svm_model.pkl`.

#### 2\. Evaluate Model Performance

```bash
python main.py eval
```

This generates the detailed classification report and confusion matrix, saving the metrics to `cnn_svm_stats.json`.

#### 3\. Predict Custom Images

```bash
python main.py predict path/to/your/digit.png
```

Example predictions on custom images:

  * `mydigit1.png` ‚Üí Predicted digit with confidence score
  * `mydigit2.png` ‚Üí Predicted digit with confidence score
  * `mydigit3.png` ‚Üí Predicted digit with confidence score

## üîß Technical Details

### Model Architecture

This hybrid model uses a "CNN as feature extractor" approach:

1.  **Feature Extractor:** A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** is trained on the MNIST images. Its purpose is not to classify but to learn a rich, hierarchical representation of the digit features.
2.  **Feature Vector:** The output from one of the final dense (fully-connected) layers of the
    CNN is extracted for each image. This vector serves as the input for the SVM.
3.  **Classifier:** A **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** (likely with an RBF kernel) is trained on these high-level feature vectors. It excels at finding an optimal decision boundary in this complex feature space.

### Image Preprocessing Pipeline

To handle custom images for prediction, a robust pipeline is used:

1.  Convert to **grayscale**.
2.  **Invert** colors (to match MNIST's white-on-black format).
3.  Apply **binary thresholding** (OTSU's method) to isolate the digit.
4.  Extract the digit's **bounding box**.
5.  Resize the digit to **20√ó20 pixels** while maintaining aspect ratio.
6.  Pad and center the digit within a **28√ó28 canvas**.
7.  **Normalize** pixel values to the [0, 1] range.
